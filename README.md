# Web Visualization Dashboard

## Latitude Analysis Dashboard

In this assignement I create a simple dashbord website using visualizations I've created in a past assignment. Specifically, I'm plotting [weather data](Resources/cities.csv). I create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
